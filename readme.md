# Hugo Starter with Netlify CMS

Dead-simple Hugo theme with Netlify CMS integration. Intended to be a starter for creating your own theme with an out-of-the-box Netlify CMS integration.

## Getting started

Use the deploy button to get your own copy of the repository.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz/hugo-starter-netlify-cms&stack=cms)

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/5607b3e4-4090-4585-845b-3289c0e8086c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/sree99/deploys)

This will setup everything needed for running the CMS:

* A new repository in your GitHub account with the code
* Full Continuous Deployment to Netlify's global CDN network
* Control users and access with Netlify Identity
* Manage content with Netlify CMS

Once the initial build finishes, you can invite yourself as a user. Go to the Identity tab in your new site, click "Invite" and send yourself an invite.

You can now add and edit content by navigating to your.app/admin.

## Local Development

Clone this repository and start the development server with `hugo serve`.

The Netlify CMS configuration file can be found in `static/admin/config.yml`.
